# Zelda's Adventure DX: Rebirth of Solarus (demo)

This is a work in progress which isn't so much a demo as a proof of concept. While the maps have gone through their first iteration and monsters have been placed, it's still very barebones and does not have a completable objective. If you decide to play this demo I would really appreciate feedback through either my Twitter or Discord (as CrookiNari).

I also request that if you do play this demo, do not spread the word about it just yet. I want to finish it without Nintendo being aware of it as while I have no intention of making any money off of this whatsoever, I know their track record for DMCA'ing any and every fan game they come across and want to give this the best possible chance of succeeding. Again, if you would like to talk to me about this project, please do so privately.

Thank you so much for checking out my silly little project :)
